# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In our heart disease prediction system, we first analyzed the evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy) of all models used. Precision values of 1 in decision tree and random forest indicated potential overfitting. Cross-validation confirmed this, necessitating an alternative approach rather than removing these models. We chose to utilize an ensemble model, combining the predictions of five different machine learning algorithms using a Voting Classifier. This approach aggregates the predictions of individual models by majority vote or weighted average.

The ensemble model was trained using the same dataset as the individual models. Post-training evaluation with standard metrics showed that the ensemble model mitigated overfitting and improved prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalization. By leveraging the strengths of multiple algorithms, the ensemble model enhanced the accuracy and reliability of our heart disease prediction system, successfully meeting our project objectives.
